**Data source**
Please provide the name and the link to the data source. Also information like the terms of use or license of the data would be helpful.

**Type of data portal**
Does the data portal provide API access? Is data available to download or only shown on the homepage? Is a registration required?

**Country/Countries/Regions**
Please list all countries or regions for which data is available at this data portal.

**Variables**
If you have information about which time series variables are available and at which temporal resolution, please list that here (e.g. daily discharge, hourly discharge, daily water temperature)

**Station list**
If available, it is tremendously helpful to have a list of all available stations including information such as station id, latitude, longitude, river, station name. You could attach such a list as a csv file to this issue. If the station list is available on the data portal, it is enough to explain for how to get that list.

**Code snippets**
If you have code snippets available for how to download data from that portal (no worries about the structure of the code) or for how to access the metadata, please provide them. This facilitates our job by a lot.
